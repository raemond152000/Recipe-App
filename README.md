# Recipe-App

In our last semester in college we made a web app for recipes that caters to everyone who wants to prep their meals according to their budget, time and nutritional needs. It's a 4 person project and each of us were assigned to  different features of the app. I was assigned to add the user authentication and add it to firestore database to add it to the collections and retrieve its fields to be use for the app.  I was also task to add the feature in saving favourites recipes to the firestore and have it retrieved on each user. I have so much fun and learn a lot from this project not only with the technical aspect with developlment but also on how we are very effecient in our communication with my team. I appreciate all of my team members who helped me with my code and their feedback.
