# Recipe-App

In our last semester in college we made a web app for our recipes that caters to everyone who wants to prep their meals according to their budget, time and nutritional needs. It's a 4 person project and each of us were assigned with different features of the app. I was assigned to add the user authentication and relate it to firestore database to add to its collections and retrieve its fields to be use for the app. I was also task to add the feature in saving favourites recipes to the firestore and have it retrieved on each user. I have so much fun and learned a lot from this project not only with the technical aspect of developlment, but also on how to work and  communicate effectively with my team members. I appreciate all of my team members who helped me with my code and their feedback.
