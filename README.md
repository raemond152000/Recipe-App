# Recipe-App

In our last semester in college, we made a web app for our recipes that caters to everyone who wants to prep their meals according to their budget, time, and nutritional needs. It's a 4 person project and each of us was assigned different features of the app. I was assigned to add the user authentication and relate it to firestore database to add to its collections and retrieve its fields to be used for the app. I was also tasked to add the feature of saving favourite recipes to the firestore and have it retrieved on each user. I have so much fun and learned a lot from this project not only with the technical aspect of development but also on how to work and communicate effectively with my team members. I appreciate all of my team members who helped me with my code and give me their feedback.
